- Use functions for each operation and implement proper input validation (e.g., insufficient
balance for withdrawal).

2. Temperature Conversion Tool
- Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
based on user input.
- Use functions for each conversion.

3. Number Guessing Game
- Develop a program where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100,
and the user guesses the number.
- Provide hints like &quot;Too High&quot; or &quot;Too Low.&quot;
- Use a loop to allow multiple attempts.

5. Shopping Cart
- Create a program to simulate a shopping cart:
- Add items (item name and price).
- View cart items.
- Calculate the total price.
- Exit.
- Use functions and a loop to allow multiple actions.

6. Prime Numbers in a Range
- Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints all the prime numbers in
that range.
- Use a function to check if a number is prime.

7. Bank Loan Eligibility
- Develop a program to check loan eligibility:
- Input: Salary, age, and credit score.
- Output: Loan approval or rejection with reasons.

8. Multiplication Table Generator
- Create a program to generate a multiplication table for any number provided by the user.
- Allow the user to specify the range of the table.

9. String Analysis Tool
- Write a program to analyze a string:
- Count vowels, consonants, digits, and special characters.
- Reverse the string and display the result.

10. Bill Splitter
